description: AWS IAM policies for Teleport database access.

Teleport automatically discovers and configures IAM for RDS and Aurora access
given proper IAM permissions as described in the [RDS guide](../guides/rds.mdx).

If you prefer to register RDS databases manually using [static configuration](./configuration.mdx)
or [`tctl`](../guides/dynamic-registration.mdx) and manage IAM yourself, example
IAM policies you'd need to create are shown below.

## RDS or Aurora policy

To connect to an RDS database, the database agent's IAM identity needs to have
`rds-db:connect` permissions for it:

<Details title="Example IAM policy document" opened={false}>
```json
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
             "rds-db:connect"
         ],
         "Resource": [
             // Use db-XXX as a resource identifier for RDS databases.
             "arn:aws:rds-db:us-east-2:1234567890:dbuser:db-ABCDEFGHIJKL01234/*",
             // Use cluster-XXX as a resource identifier for Aurora clusters.
             "arn:aws:rds-db:us-east-2:1234567890:dbuser:cluster-ABCDEFGHIJKL01234/*"
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```
</Details>

The resource ARN in the policy has the following format:

```
arn:aws:rds-db:<region>:<account-id>:dbuser:<resource-id>/<db-user>
```

| Parameter     | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| `region`      | AWS region where the database cluster is deployed. |
| `account-id`  | AWS account ID the database cluster is deployed under. |
| `resource-id` | Database AWS resource identifier: `db-XXX` for RDS, `cluster-XXX` for Aurora. Can be found under Configuration section in the RDS control panel. |
| `db-user`     | Database user to associate with IAM authentication. Can be a wildcard. |
